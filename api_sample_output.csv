0,infections,Complication Rates of Central Venous Catheters: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,68.3536376953125,"CrI, 1.0-6.2). It was estimated that 30.2 (95% CrI, 21.8-43.0) in 1000 patients with a CVC for 3 days would develop 1 or more serious complication (arterial cannulation, pneumothorax, infection, or DVT). Use of ultrasonography was associated with lower rates of arterial puncture (risk ratio [RR], 0.20; 95% CrI, 0.09-0.44; 13.5 events vs 68.8 events/1000 catheters) and pneumothorax (RR, 0.25; 95% CrI, 0.08-0.80; 2.4 events vs 9.9 events/1000 catheters). Approximately 3% of CVC placements were associated with major complications. Use of ultrasonography guidance may reduce specific risks including arterial puncture and pneumothorax.","['cri', '%', 'cri', 'a cvc', '1', 'more serious complication', 'arterial cannulation', 'pneumothorax', 'infection', 'dvt', 'ultrasonography', 'arterial puncture', 'risk ratio', 'rr', '95 %', 'cri', 'catheters', 'p', '##neumothorax', 'rr', '95 %', 'cri', '1000 cathe', 'cvc placements', 'major complications', 'ultrasonography guidance', 'arterial puncture', 'pneumothorax']"
1,infections,Incidence and predictors of complications in Gram-negative bloodstream infection.,67.40856170654297,"women. The urinary tract was the most common source of GN-BSI (378; 50.3%) and Escherichia coli was the most common bacteria (375; 49.9%). Overall, 13.9% of patients developed complications within 90 days of GN-BSI. The median time to identification of these complications was 5.2 days from initial GN-BSI. Independent risk factors for complications were presence of indwelling prosthetic material (hazards ratio [HR] 1.73, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.08-2.78), injection drug use (HR 6.84, 95% CI 1.63-28.74), non-urinary source (HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.18-3.23), BSI due to S. marcescens, P. mirabilis or P. aeruginosa (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.05-3.03), early clinical","['gn - bsi', 'escherichia coli', 'bacteria', 'complications', 'gn - bsi', 'these complications', 'gn - bsi', 'complications', 'indwelling prosthetic material', 'hazards ratio', 'hr', 'confidence intervals', 'ci', 'injection', 'hr', 'ci', 'hr', 'ci', 'bsi', 's. marcescens', 'p. mirabilis', 'p. aeruginosa', 'hr', 'ci']"
2,infections,Propensity Score-Weighted Analysis of Postoperative Infection in Patients With and Without Preoperative Urine Culture.,66.98418426513672,"surgical procedures received by males and 48.9% (141 340) received by patients 65 years or older. Baseline characteristics were well balanced among treatment groups after applying IPTW weights. Preoperative urine culture was performed for 10.5% of surgical procedures (30 384 of 288 858). The IPTW analysis found that preoperative urine culture was not associated with SSI (adjusted OR [AOR], 0.99; 95% CI, 0.90-1.10) or postoperative UTI (AOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.98-1.40). In analyses limited to orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery as a proxy for prosthetic implants, the adjusted risks for UTI and SSI were also not associated with preoperative urine culture","['surgical procedures', 'iptw weights', 'preoperative urine culture', 'surgical procedures', 'the iptw analysis', 'preoperative urine culture', 'ssi', 'c', 'postoperative uti', 'a', '95 % ci', 'prosthetic implants', 'uti', 'ssi', 'preoperative urine culture']"
